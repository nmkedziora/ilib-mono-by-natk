## Getting Started

If you're internal contributor, follow your internal guidelines.

External contributors can contribute to the project by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to the local machine.
3. Create a new branch for the feature or bugfix.
4. Make your changes.
5. Commit changes with a descriptive commit message.
6. Push changes to the forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to the main repository.

Before contributing, please set up the project on the local machine by following the instructions in
the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.

### Pull Requests

Every pull request should contain the following:

- documentation in the code (following the JSDoc/TSDoc standard)
- tests
- changelog entry.

## Environment

This project is developed using the following tools:

- Node.js for running JavaScript code.
- pnpm package manager for package management and package workspaces support.
- Turborepo for monorepo task running (caching, parallelization).

Common commands are aliased in [root `package.json`](./package.json) scripts.

## Coding Guidelines

TBD

## Adding a New Package

### Package Template

Currently, there is no package template as we are moving existing `iLib-js` packages into the monorepo without
unification.
This will be addressed in the future.

### Manual Package Creation

To manually create a new package, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory under `packages/`.
2. In the new directory, create a `package.json` file.
3. Add the following scripts to the new package's `package.json` file to plug into monorepo tasks (defined in
   `turbo.json` in the monorepo root directory):
    - `build`
    - `test`
    - `doc`

   These scripts are optional.
4. If the new package depends on another package in the monorepo, define this dependency using the workspace protocol in
   the `dependencies` section of your `packages/<packageName>/package.json`, like this:
    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "ilib-common": "workspace:^"
        }
    }
    ```
   When you run `pnpm publish`, pnpm will automatically substitute this protocol with a proper semver version.
   You can learn more about pnpm workspaces [here](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

## Running Scripts

To run scripts for a single package run commands from the package root directory.

```bash
# cd packages/loctool
pnpm [script-name] 
```

### Build

TBD

To run the build, use:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Doc

TBD

To run the doc, use:

```bash
pnpm doc
```

### Lint

TBD

### Test

There are few ways to run tests:

* for an affected package(s) solely or
* for all packages in the monorepo.

#### 1. Run tests for affected package(s)

It is recommended to run tests only for the projects impacted by recent changes, to save time and resources, and to
optimize the testing process by skipping tests for projects that haven't been modified. To do so, simply run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

#### 2. Run tests for all packages

To run all the tests for all packages in the monorepo, use:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

#### 3. Other options

These may be useful for development and/or debugging purposes.
These commands should be run from the root directory of the package you're interested in.

1. Run all the tests for a single package in the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm --filter loctool test
```

or `cd` into the package directory and run:

```bash
# cd packages/loctool
pnpm test
```

2. Run all tests for a single file, by passing the path to the file as an argument to the `pnpm test` command, like
   this:

```bash
pnpm --filter loctool test -- "ResourceConvert.test.js"
```

or `cd` into the package directory and run:

```bash
# cd packages/loctool
pnpm test -- "ResourceConvert.test.js"
```

## Debugging pluggable CLI applications

This monorepo publishes some CLI applications that support plugins; alongside, it also publishes those plugins. For example:
- [`loctool`](./packages/loctool)
  - [`ilib-loctool-json`](./packages/ilib-loctool-json)
- [`ilib-lint`](./packages/ilib-lint)
  - [`ilib-lint-react`](./packages/ilib-lint-react)

To easily debug those CLI applications with plugins directly within monorepo, you can use the environment variable [`NODE_PATH`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-from-the-global-folders).

For example, to debug `loctool` with `ilib-loctool-json` plugin, you can run:

```bash
# first make sure you have built all packages within the monorepo
pnpm build
# set NODE_PATH to monorepo context to allow loading plugins directly from the monorepo
export NODE_PATH=$(pwd)/packages
# run the app from the monorepo on a project that uses the plugin ilib-loctool-json
node loctool/lib/loctool.js localize ~/ilib-loctool-samples/js-json
```

This way, you can easily test your changes to both the CLI application and the plugin at the same time without the need to publish them or otherwise link them manually (e.g. with `yarn link`).

To make this even easier, monorepo provides `run:*` scripts which set `NODE_PATH` for you. The above example can be simplified to:

```bash
# build is still required
pnpm build
# run the app from monorepo using script
pnpm run:loctool localize ~/ilib-loctool-samples/js-json
```

Those scripts also embed the `--inspect` flag to allow debugging with e.g. VSCode's _Auto Attach: With Flag_ feature.


## Code Coverage

Currently, only some of the packages use has code coverage reporting enabled. For the other packages, code coverage will be
added in the future.

### Running Code Coverage

For the packages that already use code coverage, it has been integrated into the `ilib-mono` GitHub Actions workflow for
pull requests. Code coverage is calculated with Jest for selected packages, and the coverage report is automatically
added as a comment to each pull request.

The comment contains detailed information about the code coverage for the files changed in a PR, along with information
about uncovered lines and direct links to them. Additionally, overall information for each package is also added as a
comment to each pull request. This includes details about the percentage of covered lines (statements, branches, and
functions) and information about the number of tests (total, skipped, failures, errors) along with their execution time.

A full code coverage report is saved as an artifact and is available for download from the GitHub Actions CI workflow
for pull requests.

To run code coverage locally for all packages in the monorepo, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm coverage
```
To run it only for affected package(s), use:

```bash
pnpm coverage:affected
```

Additionally, code coverage can be run for a single package in the monorepo by navigating to the package directory:

```bash
# cd packages/package-name
pnpm coverage
```
The `coverage` script in all of these cases produces, in the root of the package,  a `coverage/` directory, as well as `coverage.txt` and `junit.xml` files containing the code coverage details.

### Adding Code Coverage
To include a new package in the code coverage comment in a pull request, follow these steps:  

1. Define the `coverage` script in `package.json`. This script should generate the coverage report.
     ```bash
    "scripts": {
        # ...
        "coverage": "pnpm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters json-summary --coverageReporters html --coverageReporters text > ./coverage.txt --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit",
    }
    ```
    
2. .Update GitHub Actions Workflow for pull request. Add the package coverage source to the `test-affected` workflow in the `.github/workflows/test-affected.yml` file.
Specifically, update the Jest Code Coverage Comment step to include the new package in both `multiple-files` and `multiple-junitxml-files`.
    ```yml
    - name: Jest Code Coverage Comment
      # ...
      with:
        multiple-files: |
          # ...
          package-name, ./packages/package-name/coverage/coverage-summary.json
        multiple-junitxml-files: |
          #...
          package-name, ./packages/package-name/junit.xml
    ```

By following these steps, the package will be included in the code coverage report, and the results will be automatically commented on each pull request to `ilib-mono`.
