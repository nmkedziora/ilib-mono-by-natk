# ilib-mono

This repository is a monorepo for the [iLib-js project](https://github.com/iLib-js).
It aims to contain all the packages that are part of the iLib-js, even though every package is published to npm as a separate package.

The monorepo is managed using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo.

All packages are placed in the `packages/` directory.
Each package has its own `README.md` and `package.json`, which are located in the package root directory.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development.

iLib-js packages are now being migrated to this monorepo.
All the packages that are moved to the monorepo are marked as 'archived' in their original GitHub repositories.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `packages/` - Contains all the packages that are part of the monorepo. Each package is a separate directory containing its own `package.json` file. Each package is published to npm as a separate package.
- `package.json` - Contains the root project configuration.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Contains the configuration for pnpm workspaces.
- `turbo.json` - Contains the configuration for Turborepo.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Contains the lockfile for pnpm.

## Targeted Node.js Versions
`ilib-mono` aim to target Node.js versions >=12.0.0 when building packages for npm registry.

## Usage
To use packages in this monorepo, import them as any other npm package.
For example, to use the `ilib-common` package from within any other package in the `/packages` directory, import it like this:
```javascript
import { JSUtils, Utils, Path } from 'ilib-common';
```
